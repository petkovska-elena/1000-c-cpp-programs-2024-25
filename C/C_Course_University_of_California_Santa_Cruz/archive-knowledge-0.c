//VOID meaning: No arguments

//\n is being used to print in a new line, \n\n for two new lines

//%lf (long float) is a format specifier for printing double

/* Identifiers:
 * * Good choice of identifiers help document the program well and make the code more readable
 * main
 * printf
 * radius */

/*Types:
 *float, double, long double
 * /

/* Understanding int (32 bit):
 * Other ints:
 * short
 * long
 * unsigned */

/* The return statement:
 * main returns a value 0:
 * returns a value of 0 to the operating system - meaning: the program finished in an orderly and expected way
 * main returns a value 1 */

/* Function variables - with call-by-value:
* When you pass a variable (like k) to a function in C, a copy of the variable’s value is made.
Any changes to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. */

/* Scope rules:
 * Involve declarations -> blocks
* In C, variables and functions follow scope rules that define where they exist and for how long —
* variables declared inside a block are only accessible within that block, and are destroyed when the block ends.
Nested blocks can have variables with the same name as outer ones, but inner declarations take precedence. */
